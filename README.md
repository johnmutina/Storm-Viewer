# Storm-Viewer
Project #1 - Image Viewer

Following a tutorial, I created a simple image visualization app. The user is presented with a table view containing picture names. By clicking on a row, the related image is shown, along with the navigation bar.

Navigation bar can be deactivated by tapping once and reactivated by tapping again. On iPhoneX, the home button disappears when navigation bar disappears.

If interested, the tutorial comes from the great [Hacking With Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com)
